Experimental features
=====================

First introduced in EasyBuild v2.1.0 (see :ref:`EasyBuild v2.1.0 Release Notes <release_notes_v2.1.0>`), experimental features can only be invoked by adding a ``--experimental`` option when running ``eb``.

An experimental feature indicates to users that these features may change significantly in a future release and should be used only for testing.

Currently enabled experimental features include:
 * Cray support
 * Binary Packaging Support (see :ref:`creating_binary_packages`)
