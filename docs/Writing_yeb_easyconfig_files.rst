.. _easyconfig_yeb_format:

Writing easyconfig files in YAML syntax (``.yeb`` format) **[IN DEVELOPMENT]**
==============================================================================

.. note::
    Because support for easyconfig files in YAML syntax (a.k.a. ``.yeb`` files) is still *in development*,
    using them currently requires enabling the use of experimental features (``--experimental``),
    see also :ref:`experimental_features` .

    An up-to-date overview of current progress on support for ``.yeb`` easyconfigs is available at
    https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-framework/issues/1407.

.. _easyconfig_yeb_format_syntax:

Syntax
------

.. _easyconfig_yeb_format_syntax_YAML_header:

YAML header (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Easyconfig files in YAML syntax can start with a standard YAML header.

It consists of two lines:

* a line with a '``%YAML``' *directive* which also indicates the YAML version being used
  (the latest YAML version is 1.2, and dates from 2009);
* followed by a *document marker* line '``---``' (which is used to separate directives from content)

For example::

    %YAML 1.2
    ---

This header is optional, but we recommend including it; one advantage is that editor will use proper syntax
highlighting for YAML when the ``%YAML`` directory is included.

.. _easyconfig_yeb_format_syntax_comments:

Comments
~~~~~~~~

Comments can be included anywhere, and are prefixed with a hash character ``#``::

    # this is a comment

.. _internal_variables_yaml:

Internal variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables can be defined using standard YAML anchors (using a '&'). These are later referenced using an asterisk (*).
Example::
    _internal_variables:
        - &name foo_name
        - &version 1.2.3

    example_key: [*name, *version]  # will return [foo_name, 1.2.3]

To concat strings and variables, or multiple variables together, use the !join operator
(See `Concatenating strings and/or variables`_)

.. _string_concatenation:

Concatenating strings and/or variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As string concatenation is not supported in YAML, we defined a !join operator. It takes a list of values to concatenate
as argument. This list can contain both hard strings and variables.
Example::

    !join [foo, bar]  # returns 'foobar'
    vars:
        - &f foo
        - &b bar
    !join [*f, bar]  # returns 'foobar'
    !join [*f, *b]  # returns 'foobar'


.. _easyconfig_yeb_format_syntax_easyconfig_parameters:

Easyconfig parameter values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To define an easyconfig parameter, simply use ``<key>: <value>`` (i.e., use a colon ``:`` as a separator).

In YAML terminology, an easyconfig file is expressed as a *mapping*, with easyconfig parameters as keys.

Three types of values (*nodes*) are supported: *scalars* (strings, integers), *sequences* (lists) and *mappings*
(dictionaries).

Scalar values
#############

Using scalar values is straight-forward, no special syntax is required.

For string values, no quotes must be used (in general).
However, quotes are sometimes required to escape characters that have special meaning in YAML (like '``:``').
It's worth noting that there's a subtle difference between using single and double quotes, see
`Flow Scalar Styles <http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2786942>`_.

Examples::

    name: gzip
    version: 1.6

    # single quotes are required for string values representing URLs, to escape the ':'
    homepage: 'http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/'

    parallel: 1

Multiline strings can be expressed using indentation::

        gzip is a popular data compression program
        as a replacement for compress

Sequences
#########

Sequence values (a.k.a. lists) can be expressed in different ways, depending on their size.

If there are a limited number of (short) entries the value can be expressed on a single line,
using square brackets '``[``' '``]``' and with comma '``,``' as separator.

Example::

    # quotes are required to escape the ':'
    source_urls: ['http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gzip/', 'ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gzip/']

Alternatively indentation can be used for scope, with each entry on its own line,
indicated with a dash and a space ``- ``.

Example::

    # no quotes required here, since there's no ambiguity w.r.t. ':'
    source_urls:
        - http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gzip/
        - http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gzip/
        - ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gzip/

Mappings
########

Mapping values (a.k.a. dictionaries) are expressed using a colon '``:``' and space as key-value separator,
a comma '``,``' to key-value pairs, and curly braces '``{``' '``}``' to mark the start/end.

For example::

    toolchain: {name: intel, version: 2015b}

Nesting
#######

Different types of values can be nested.

For example, sequence values can be used in a mapping::

    sanity_check_paths: {
        files: [bin/gunzip, bin/gzip, bin/uncompress],
        dirs: [],
    }


.. _easyconfig_yeb_format_syntax_template_values_constants:

Templates values and constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Template values can be specified as a part of string values, using ``%(template_name)``.

Template constants are injected by the easyconfig ``.yeb`` parser as *node anchors*,
and can be referred to with an *alias node*, i.e. using an asterisk ``*``.

For example::

    source_urls: [*GNU_SOURCE]
    sources: ['%(name)s-%(version)s.tar.gz']  # equivalent with [*SOURCE_TAR_GZ]

See also :ref:`easyconfig_param_templates`.

.. _easyconfig_yeb_format_syntax_dependencies:

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dependecies in .yeb work just like they do in .eb files, except with the YAML syntax as described above. As there are no
tuples in YAML, work with nested lists.
An example::
    dependencies: [
        [libreadline, 6.3],
        [Tcl, 8.6.4]
    ]

A more complicated (toolchain) example::

    _internal_variables_:
        - &version 1.4.10

        - &comp_name GCC
        - &comp_version 4.7.2
        - &comp [*comp_name, *comp_version]

        - &blaslib OpenBLAS
        - &blasver 0.2.6
        - &blas !join [*blaslib, -, *blasver]
        - &blas_suff -LAPACK-3.4.2

        - &comp_mpi_tc [gompi, *version]

        [FFTW, 3.3.3, '', *comp_mpi_tc],
        [ScaLAPACK, 2.0.2, !join [-, *blas, *blas_suff], *comp_mpi_tc]
