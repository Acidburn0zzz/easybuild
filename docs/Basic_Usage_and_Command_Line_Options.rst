Basic Usage and Command Line Options
====================================

Basic usage
===========
 
``eb`` command line
-------------------
 
``eb`` is EasyBuild’s main command line tool, to interact with the EasyBuild framework.
see ``eb --help`` w.r.t. usage, see ``eb --version`` 

Providing an easyconfig file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Most basic usage is to simply provide the name of an easyconfig file to ``eb``.
 
EasyBuild will (try and) locate the easyconfig file, and perform the installation as specified by the easyconfig file.
 
Build & install bzip2 v1.0.6 (using system compiler)::
 
  $ eb bzip2-1.0.6.eb
  == temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/easybuild-0f0xKN/easybuild-oI1vAm.log
  == resolving dependencies ...
  == processing EasyBuild easyconfig /Users/fgeorgatos/.local/easybuild/software/EasyBuild/1.15.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/easybuild_easyconfigs-1.15.2.0-py2.7.egg/easybuild/easyconfigs/b/bzip2/bzip2-1.0.6.eb
  == building and installing bzip2/1.0.6...
  == fetching files...
  == creating build dir, resetting environment...
  == unpacking...
  == patching...
  == preparing...
  == configuring...
  == building...
  == testing...
  == installing...
  == taking care of extensions...
  == packaging...
  == postprocessing...
  == sanity checking...
  == cleaning up...
  == creating module...
  == COMPLETED: Installation ended successfully
  == Results of the build can be found in the log file /Users/fgeorgatos/.local/easybuild/software/bzip2/1.0.6/easybuild/easybuild-bzip2-1.0.6-20141029.013716.log
  == Build succeeded for 1 out of 1
  == temporary log file /tmp/easybuild-0f0xKN/easybuild-oI1vAm.log has been removed.
  == temporary directory /tmp/easybuild-0f0xKN has been removed.

  $ module load bzip2/1.0.6
  $ which bzip2
  /Users/fgeorgatos/.local/easybuild/software/bzip2/1.0.6/bin/bzip2
 
 
.. tip:: easyconfig file names (end with .eb, follow format <name>-<version>-<toolchain>-<versionsuffix>, see JSC slides)
 
 
Using only command line options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
An alternative approach is to only use command line options to specify which software to build:
 
build & install last version of bzip2 (that EasyBuild is aware of) using ``dummy`` toolchain (i.e., using system compiler)::
 
  $ time eb --software-name=bzip2 --toolchain-name=dummy
  == temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/easybuild-3AzStZ/easybuild-YD_fMf.log
  == resolving dependencies ...
  == processing EasyBuild easyconfig /Users/fgeorgatos/.local/easybuild/software/EasyBuild/1.15.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/easybuild_easyconfigs-1.15.2.0-py2.7.egg/easybuild/easyconfigs/b/bzip2/bzip2-1.0.6.eb
  == building and installing bzip2/1.0.6...
  == fetching files...
  == creating build dir, resetting environment...
  == unpacking...
  == patching...
  == preparing...
  == configuring...
  == building...
  == testing...
  == installing...
  == taking care of extensions...
  == packaging...
  == postprocessing...
  == sanity checking...
  == cleaning up...
  == creating module...
  == COMPLETED: Installation ended successfully
  == Results of the build can be found in the log file /Users/fgeorgatos/.local/easybuild/software/bzip2/1.0.6/easybuild/easybuild-bzip2-1.0.6-20141029.013514.log
  == Build succeeded for 1 out of 1
  == temporary log file /tmp/easybuild-3AzStZ/easybuild-YD_fMf.log has been removed.
  == temporary directory /tmp/easybuild-3AzStZ has been removed.

Providing multiple easyconfig files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Multiple easyconfig files can be provided as well, either directly or by specifying a directory that contains easyconfig files::
 
  $ time eb bzip2-1.0.6.eb GCC-4.8.3.eb
  == temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/easybuild-pGof8u/easybuild-GNYSey.log
  == bzip2/1.0.6 is already installed (module found), skipping
  == resolving dependencies ...
  == processing EasyBuild easyconfig /Users/fgeorgatos/.local/easybuild/software/EasyBuild/1.15.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/easybuild_easyconfigs-1.15.2.0-py2.7.egg/easybuild/easyconfigs/g/GCC/GCC-4.8.3.eb
  == building and installing GCC/4.8.3...
  == fetching files...
  == creating build dir, resetting environment...
  == unpacking...
  == patching...
  == preparing...
  == configuring...
  == building...
  == testing...
  == installing...
  == taking care of extensions...
  == packaging...
  == postprocessing...
  == sanity checking...
  == cleaning up...
  == creating module...
  == COMPLETED: Installation ended successfully
  == Results of the build can be found in the log file /Users/fgeorgatos/.local/easybuild/software/GCC/4.8.3/easybuild/easybuild-GCC-4.8.3-20141029.024018.log
  == Build succeeded for 1 out of 1
  == temporary log file /tmp/easybuild-pGof8u/easybuild-GNYSey.log has been removed.
  == temporary directory /tmp/easybuild-pGof8u has been removed.
  
  real	58m45.188s
  user	92m53.829s
  sys	18m14.947s

::

  $ ls set_of_easyconfigs/
  GCC-4.8.3.eb	bzip2-1.0.6.eb

::

  $ eb set_of_easyconfigs/
  == temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/easybuild-1yxCvv/easybuild-NeNmZr.log
  == bzip2/1.0.6 is already installed (module found), skipping
  == GCC/4.8.3 is already installed (module found), skipping
  == No easyconfigs left to be built.
  == Build succeeded for 0 out of 0
  == temporary log file /tmp/easybuild-1yxCvv/easybuild-NeNmZr.log has been removed.
  == temporary directory /tmp/easybuild-1yxCvv has been removed.
 
.. note:: EasyBuild will only pick up the files which end with .eb ; anything else will be ignored.
 
.. tip:: Calling EasyBuild is designed as an `idempotent` operation; if one of the proposed builds is available as a module,
  it will simply be skipped, if not a build is attempted. You can rerun your eb command until all builds are finished,
  esp. in case a mishap breaks the build effort at any time (full disk, OS shutdown, or even user processes kill).


Commonly used command line options
----------------------------------
 
[[EB cmdline??]] - XXX
 
Basic Usage, --help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Use ``eb —help``/``-H``, ``eb -h`` - XXX

Refer to page :ref:`basicusagehelp` for more information.

Overview of known toolchains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
``eb --list-toolchains``, refer to page `Toolchain Tables`
(make sure example output of --list-toolchains is in a separate file, so it’s easy to auto-update for new releases)
 
:ref:`Toolchains Table`

List of available easyblocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
List of available easyblocks via ``--list-easyblocks``
 
Software-specific easyblocks have a name that starts with ``EB_`; the ones that do not are generic easyblocks.
 
List of generic easyblocks::
 
     eb --list-easyblocks | grep -v ^EB_
 
Refer to page :ref:`basicusageeasyblocks` for more information.

Refer to page :ref:`easyconfigsparameters` for more information on the individual options.

.. tip:: Combine with --easyblock/-e to include parameters that are specific to a particular easyblock; fi. ``eb -a -e EB_WRF``;
  default is to include ConfigureMake specific-ones (e.g., prefix_opt)

(refer to external page that lists all available easyconfig parameters, maybe even in a nicer format than just a literal dump of the “eb -a” output (i.e. with a one-liner before dumping the output to a file) - XXX - Need to convert -a output to .rst format

Enable debug logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``eb --debug/-d`` to enable debug logging, to include all details of how EasyBuild performed a build in the log file

.. tip:: enable this by default by adding ``debug = True`` in EasyBuild configuration file

.. tip:: makes log files significantly bigger


Forced reinstallation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``eb --force/-f`` to force the reinstallation of a given easyconfig/module.

.. warning:: Use with care since this will rebuild and reinstall an existing module, which may be used as a dependency for something else!

Searching for easyconfigs
-----------------------------------

Use ``--search/-S`` (long vs short output) + an easyconfig filename pattern, for case-insensitive search of easyconfigs::

  $ eb -S WRF-3.5.1
  == temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/easybuild-muFTYO/easybuild-d8Lcqq.log
  == Searching (case-insensitive) for 'WRF-3.5.1' in /Users/fgeorgatos/.local/easybuild/software/EasyBuild/1.15.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/easybuild_easyconfigs-1.15.2.0-py2.7.egg/easybuild/easyconfigs

  == temporary log file /tmp/easybuild-muFTYO/easybuild-d8Lcqq.log has been removed.
  == temporary directory /tmp/easybuild-muFTYO has been removed.
  
  $ eb -S /GCC-4.9.1
  == temporary log file in case of crash /tmp/easybuild-HJ7qa4/easybuild-JaBakE.log
  == Searching (case-insensitive) for '/GCC-4.9.1' in /Users/fgeorgatos/.local/easybuild/software/EasyBuild/1.15.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/easybuild_easyconfigs-1.15.2.0-py2.7.egg/easybuild/easyconfigs
  CFGS1=/Users/fgeorgatos/.local/easybuild/software/EasyBuild/1.15.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/easybuild_easyconfigs-1.15.2.0-py2.7.egg/easybuild/easyconfigs/g/GCC
   * $CFGS1/GCC-4.9.1-CLooG-multilib.eb

  == temporary log file /tmp/easybuild-HJ7qa4/easybuild-JaBakE.log has been removed.
  == temporary directory /tmp/easybuild-HJ7qa4 has been removed.

.. tip:: By using a leading slash in front of a search pattern, we filter out all the potential matches
  of easyconfigs that are built with GCC (as opposed to the easyconfigs of GCC itself, which is our intention).


Dependency resolution
-------------------------------

Take make EasyBuild try and resolve dependencies, using the --robot/-r command line option.

     $ eb WRF-3.5.1-goolf-1.4.10-dmpar.eb —robot | grep "building and installing"
     (show output)
