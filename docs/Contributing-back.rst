.. _contributing_back_pull_requests:

Pull requests
-------------

To contribute back to the EasyBuild framework, easyblocks, easyconfig files
or the EasyBuild documentation, you will need to open a pull request to the
corresponding GitHub repository:

* EasyBuild framework: https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-framework
* easyblocks: https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-easyblocks
* easyconfigs: https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-easyconfigs
* documentation: https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild (see ``docs`` subdirectory)

Doing this the traditional way requires some knowledge about using ``git``
(i.e. creating commits, using branches, pushing to and pulling from remote
Git repositories, etc.), and being familiar with GitHub.

However, this can be largely circumvented by using the GitHub integration
provided by EasyBuild, see :ref:`integration_with_github`.


.. _contributing_back_pull_request_setup:

Setting up
~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: These instructions assume that you already have a working GitHub account.

          If you don't have a GitHub account yet, visit https://github.com/ to create one.

          Make sure you have registered your SSH public key in your GitHub account,
          via https://github.com/settings/keys.

Before you can open pull requests, you will need to **fork** the GitHub repository
you are targeting, and create a local **working copy** of that repository. This only
needs to be done *once* for every of the EasyBuild repositories.

.. note:: For the purpose of this guide, we will be using the ``easybuild-framework`` repository.

          However, the instructions are analogous for the other EasyBuild repositories.

.. _contributing_back_pull_request_setup_fork_repo:

Forking the repository
++++++++++++++++++++++

First, create your own *fork* of the repository in your GitHub account using the
'``Fork``' button on the top right at https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-framework.

This will basically create a 'copy' of the ``easybuild-framework`` repository
owned by the ``hpcugent`` GitHub organisation to your own personal GitHub account.

You will have to use this fork as a staging area for your work,
to prepare your contributions before creating the actual pull requests.

.. _contributing_back_pull_request_setup_working_copy:

Creating a working copy
+++++++++++++++++++++++

In addition to forking the repository on GitHub, you also need to create
a local *working copy* of the repository. This is basically a local checkout
of the repository where you can track the changes you are making.

First, *clone* the repository:

.. code:: shell

  git clone git@github.com:hpcugent/easybuild-framework.git

If that worked as expected, you should have a new directory named ``easybuild-framework``.
Move into the ``easybuild-framework`` directory:

.. code:: shell

  cd easybuild-framework

Then, add your own fork as a '*remote*' repository:

.. code:: shell

  git remote add myfork git@github.com:EXAMPLE/easybuild-framework.git

.. note:: **Do not forget to replace** '``EXAMPLE``' **with your GitHub account name.**

          '``myfork``' is just a name that you give to the remote for your
          fork of the repository on GitHub; you can modify this to your liking
          if desired (but do take that into account for the further instructions if you do so).

          For the central repository, a default remote named ``origin`` should
          have been created via ``git clone`` (see the output of ``git remote -v``).

Finally, it is recommended to also check out the ``develop`` branch,
which will be used as the base for your own branches:

.. code:: shell

  git checkout -b develop origin/develop

With this in place, you are all set to open pull requests for your contributions.

.. _contributing_back_creating_pull_requests:

Opening a new pull request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: This section describes the manual procedure to open a new pull request.

          Please consider using ``eb --new-pr`` instead, see :ref:`github_new_pr`.

.. note:: We are assuming you are already located in your local working copy of
          the repository you want to contribute to (e.g., ``easybuild-framework``).

To open a pull request for your contribution, you must follow these steps:

i. :ref:`contributing_back_creating_pull_requests_branch`
ii. :ref:`contributing_back_creating_pull_requests_commit`
iii. :ref:`contributing_back_creating_pull_requests_push`
iv. :ref:`contributing_back_creating_pull_requests_open_pr`


.. _contributing_back_creating_pull_requests_branch:

Creating a new branch
+++++++++++++++++++++

First, create a new branch for your work. You can do this either before
or after making the changes that you would like to contribute back, but we
recommend to create a new branch before making any changes.

Make sure you have the ``develop`` branch checked out before creating your branch:

.. code:: shell

  git checkout develop

To create a new branch, you should use ``git branch <branch_name>`` followed by
``git checkout <branch_name>``, or equivalently ``git checkout -b <branch_name>``.

For example, to create a new branch named ``mybranch``:

.. code:: shell

  git checkout -b mybranch

You can choose the branch name freely, but make it sufficiently descriptive --
your future self will thank you.


.. _contributing_back_creating_pull_requests_commit:

Committing your changes
+++++++++++++++++++++++

To 'save' your changes, you should create one or more *commits* in the branch
you created. It is recommended to make separate commits for different 'units of work'.

First, make sure you have checked out the branch were you want to commit the changes to.

For example, to commit changes to the ``mybranch`` branch:

.. code:: shell

  git checkout mybranch

To check which branch is currently checked out, use ``git branch``.

To get a high-level overview of the changes before committing them, you can use ``git status``.

To see the actual changes that were made, use ``git diff``.

To commit the changes you want to contribute back, use ``git add <files>``
to *stage* the changes, followed by ``git commit -m "<message>"`` to create
the actual commit.

For example, to commit the changes that were made to ``easybuild/tools/filetools.py``:

.. code:: shell

  git add easybuild/tools/filetools.py
  git status  # check which files are staged for commit
  git commit -m "example commit message for changes to filetools.py"

.. note:: Please use a concise commit message that describes the changes you made.

To create a single commit for *all* the changes that were made, use ``git commit -am "<message"``.

For example:

.. code:: shell

  # first, check changes to make sure we want to commit them all at once
  git status
  git diff

  git commit -am "example commit message for all the changes that were made"

To verify that your work was committed, use ``git log`` to see all commits
on the current branch. Use ``git log --stat`` and/or ``git log --diff`` to see
more details about which changes are included in each of the commits.


.. _contributing_back_creating_pull_requests_push:

Pushing your branch
+++++++++++++++++++

Once you have committed your changes to a branch, you should *push* your
branch to your fork of the GitHub repository using ``git push``.

For example, to push the ``mybranch`` branch to the ``myfork`` remote GitHub repository:

.. code:: shell

  git push myfork mybranch

Note that this is equivalent to making your work public.


.. _contributing_back_creating_pull_requests_open_pr:

Opening the pull request
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To open a pull request using the branch you pushed,
you should use the GitHub interface, and follow the steps outlined below.

.. note:: Replace '``EXAMPLE``' with your GitHub account name, and
          '``easybuild-framework``' with the name of the target EasyBuild repository.

i. visit https://github.com/EXAMPLE/easybuild-framework;
ii. switch to the branch that includes the changes you want to contribute back
    using the '``Branch: master``' button on the left;
iii. click the '``New pull request``' button;
iv. change the target branch to ``develop`` using the '``base: master``' button;
v. provide an appropriate title and description for your contribution;
vi. open the pull request by clicking the green '``Create pull request``' button

Next, your pull request will be reviewed & tested, see :ref:`contributing_back_review_process`.

.. _contributing_back_updating_pull_requests:

Updating existing pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: This section describes the manual procedure to create a new pull request.

          Please consider using ``eb --update-pr`` instead, see :ref:`github_update_pr`.

It is quite common to update a pull request after creating it, for example
because Travis reports problems with the changes being made, or as a response
to someone reviewing your contribution.

To update an existing pull request, it suffices to add commits to the branch
that was used for opening the pull request, and pushing the updated branch to GitHub.

For example, to update the pull request that was created using the ``mybranch`` branch:

.. code:: shell

  git checkout mybranch
  # make changes...
  git commit -am "example commit message for additional changes"
  git push myfork mybranch

Updating a pull request will trigger Travis to re-test your contribution,
and a notification will be sent out to whoever is 'watching' your pull request.


.. _contributing_back_merging_pull_requests:

Merging of pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once your pull request have been given the green light by Travis,
and one or more people reviewing have approved the changes, it can be merged into
the ``develop`` branch. This can only be done by someone in the EasyBuild
'*admin*' team.

Usually, merging a pull request implies that the changes will be part of the next EasyBuild release.


.. _contributing_back_review_process:

Review process for contributions
--------------------------------

Each contribution is thoroughly reviewed and tested before it gets merged in.
Some aspects of this are fully automated, others require human intervention.

It is important to be aware of all of the aspects of the review process,
since only contributions that fulfill all of the requirements discussed below
are eligible for being merged in.


.. _contributing_back_review_process_travis:

Test suite (Travis)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each pull request is tested automatically by Travis, and the test result
is reported in the pull request.

**Only pull requests that have been tested and approved by Travis are
eligible for being merged!**

Note that Travis will only run the *unit test suite* for that particular repository.
That is, for easyconfig contributions it does *not* include
actually building and installing software.


.. _contributing_back_review_process_backward_compatibility:

Backward compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contributions should retain *backward compatibility*, i.e., they should *not*
make any changes that alter the (default) semantics of the existing code base.
Of course, enhancements to existing code that retain backward compatibility can be made.

One exception to this rule is *bug fixes*, where the whole point is usually
to fix functionality that was implemented incorrectly.

This also applies to existing easyconfig files; for example, the versions
of dependencies should *not* be altered. Adding dependencies that where missing
or otherwise enhancing existing easyconfigs (e.g., adding extra extensions,
enabling additional features, etc.) are usually considered acceptable.

In any case, changes that break backward compatibility have to be motivated
well with technical arguments, and must be approved by the maintainers of EasyBuild.


.. _contributing_back_review_process_code_style:

Code style review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next to functional evaluation of contributions, care is also taken to
maintain a consistent code style across the EasyBuild code base
(see also :ref:`code_style`).

This aspect is sometimes considered to be needless overhead, yet it is an
important aspect of the review process. A consistent code style is invaluable
in a large code base that is constantly being updated by a worldwide community.

This also applies to easyconfig files, where we try to maintain a strict style
that mostly matches the established PEP8 coding style for Python (since
easyconfigs are written in Python syntax). However, also the grouping and
ordering of easyconfig parameters is a part of the 'code' style we maintain.


.. _contributing_back_review_process_review_pr:

Comparing with existing easyconfigs (``--review-pr``)
