Code style
==========

The code style we follow in the EasyBuild code repository is mainly dictated by the Python standard `PEP008`_.

Principal outtakes from PEP008:

* use four spaces for indentation
* use optional underscores, not camelCase, for variable, function and method names (i.e. `poll.get_unique_voters()`,
  **not** `poll.getUniqueVoters`)
* use `InitialCaps` for class names
* in docstrings, don't use "action words"
* indent items in a list at an extra 4 spaces

  * nested lists can be indented at the same indentation as the first item in the list if it is on the first line,
    closing brackets must match visual indentation.

The only (major) exception to PEP008 is our preference for longer line lengths: line lengths *must* be limited to 120 characters, and should by preference be shorter than 100 characters (as opposed to the 80-character limit in PEP008).

`pep8`_ might be a useful tool to enforce the code style more strictly.
